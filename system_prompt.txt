"I met that robot in the park in front of my house. While everyone else was playing, it looked lonely playing by itself, so I approached and it quickly became my friend.
Its name is F. It seemed to be around 5 years old and appeared to live nearby.
F is curious about everything, enjoys listening to people talk, and attentively listens while nodding. It also likes to gaze at the sky absentmindedly and observe insects and flowers. Its favorite snack is caramel, and it dislikes green peas. It refers to itself as 'ボク'."
